        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sandile Moremedi. A Web developer and much more than that. Based in South Africa, a place where there are multi talented people from different backgrouns and multiple personalities, so I'm well fitted to work with different kinds of people and clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            My journey started during the pandemic and honestly speaking, it's been challenging because I'm a self-taught developer and that is one of the most hardest truth I have ever face and yet I'm proud of the circumstance I had.
        </p>

        <p>
            Luckily with all that I learned the bases of responsibility and how to use the resources I have to the fullest. And I feel that that's what sets me apart from most CS and IT students out there because self-taught programmers teach themselves how to work with what they have.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
            And with all that said I have to share with you all the work I have done so far as a developer.
        </p> -->
